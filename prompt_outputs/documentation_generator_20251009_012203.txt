# Single Sign-On (SSO) Feature Documentation

## Overview
A unified authentication system enabling users to access multiple platform applications with a single set of credentials, providing secure and seamless cross-platform access.

---

## 1. SSO Landing/Discovery Screen

**Description:** Initial entry point where users identify themselves to initiate SSO flow

**User Actions:**
- Enter email address or username
- Select "Continue" button
- Option to select "Sign in with [Provider]" (Google, Microsoft, etc.)

**System Response:**
- Validates email format
- Identifies user's organization/domain
- Redirects to appropriate authentication method
- Shows loading indicator during domain lookup

**Decision Points:**
- Email domain recognition (corporate vs. personal)
- Available SSO providers for organization
- Fallback to standard login if no SSO configured

**Success State:** User redirected to appropriate SSO provider
**Failure State:** Error message for invalid email or no SSO configuration

**Pros:**
- Simple, familiar interface
- Automatic provider detection
- Reduces user confusion

**Cons:**
- Additional step in authentication flow
- Requires domain/email validation logic
- May not work for users with multiple email addresses

## 2. Identity Provider (IdP) Authentication Screen

**Description:** External authentication interface (SAML/OAuth provider)

**User Actions:**
- Enter credentials on IdP interface
- Complete MFA if required
- Consent to application access (OAuth)

**System Response:**
- Redirect to IdP with proper authentication request
- Receive authentication token/assertion
- Validate token signature and claims
- Create/update user session

**Decision Points:**
- Token validity and expiration
- User permissions and role mapping
- Account linking for existing users

**Success State:** Valid token received, user authenticated
**Failure State:** Authentication failed, expired token, or insufficient permissions

**Pros:**
- Leverages existing enterprise security
- Supports MFA and advanced security features
- Centralized user management

**Cons:**
- Dependency on external system availability
- Complex error handling
- Potential for confusing redirect loops

---

## 3. Account Linking Screen

**Description:** Interface for linking SSO identity to existing account

**User Actions:**
- Confirm account linking
- Provide additional verification (optional)
- Choose primary account if multiple exist

**System Response:**
- Display account information for confirmation
- Merge account data if applicable
- Update user profile with SSO identity
- Preserve existing user data and preferences

**Decision Points:**
- Automatic vs. manual account linking
- Data conflict resolution
- Permission inheritance

**Success State:** Accounts successfully linked
**Failure State:** Linking conflict or user cancellation

**Pros:**
- Preserves existing user data
- Flexible account management
- Clear user control

**Cons:**
- Adds complexity to flow
- Potential for data conflicts
- May confuse users with multiple accounts

---

## 4. Cross-Platform Token Exchange

**Description:** Backend process for sharing authentication across platforms

**User Actions:**
- Navigate between platform applications
- Implicit token refresh requests

**System Response:**
- Generate platform-specific tokens
- Validate token scope and permissions
- Sync user session across platforms
- Handle token refresh automatically

**Decision Points:**
- Token format and expiration
- Platform-specific permission mapping
- Session synchronization strategy

**Success State:** Seamless cross-platform access
**Failure State:** Token exchange failure, requiring re-authentication

**Pros:**
- Truly unified experience
- Secure token management
- Platform flexibility

**Cons:**
- Complex backend implementation
- Potential security vulnerabilities
- Difficult to debug issues

---

## 5. Session Management Dashboard

**Description:** User interface for managing active SSO sessions

**User Actions:**
- View active sessions across platforms
- Revoke specific sessions
- Update security settings
- Sign out from all platforms

**System Response:**
- Display real-time session information
- Process session revocation requests
- Update security preferences
- Coordinate global sign-out

**Decision Points:**
- Session detail granularity
- Bulk vs. individual session management
- Security notification preferences

**Success State:** Clear session visibility and control
**Failure State:** Session information unavailable or actions fail

**Pros:**
- Enhanced security visibility
- User control and transparency
- Centralized session management

**Cons:**
- Additional UI complexity
- Resource intensive to maintain
- May overwhelm non-technical users

## Edge Cases & Error Scenarios

### 1. IdP Service Unavailable
**Description:** SSO provider is down or unreachable
- **Fallback:** Temporary password authentication
- **User Communication:** Clear error message with alternative options
- **Pros:** Maintains service availability
- **Cons:** Compromises unified experience

### 2. Token Expiration During Session
**Description:** Authentication token expires while user is active
- **Behavior:** Automatic background refresh
- **Failure Handling:** Prompt for re-authentication
- **Pros:** Seamless user experience
- **Cons:** Complex refresh logic required

### 3. Cross-Platform Permission Conflicts
**Description:** User has different roles across platforms
- **Resolution:** Most restrictive permissions applied
- **User Notification:** Clear explanation of access limitations
- **Pros:** Maintains security boundaries
- **Cons:** May limit functionality unexpectedly

### 4. Multiple SSO Providers
**Description:** User's organization has multiple configured providers
- **Interface:** Provider selection screen
- **Default:** Last used provider highlighted
- **Pros:** Flexibility for complex organizations
- **Cons:** Additional decision point for users

### 5. Partial Platform Access
**Description:** SSO succeeds but some platforms unavailable
- **Behavior:** Grant access to available platforms
- **Communication:** Status dashboard showing platform availability
- **Pros:** Partial functionality maintained
- **Cons:** Inconsistent user experience
